    LTN, implements the simpliest form of the above
    conv operator on that can be defined in the context of
    complexes that appear in the algebraic
    topology (simplicial, cellular, polyhedral, etc).
    Precisly, LTN takes the form:
    .. math::
    X^{t}_{i+1}= M(G,X^{s}_{i}) =G * X^s_{i} * W  ----[1],
    where :math:`G:C^s(X)->C^t(X)`, where :math:`C^i(X)` is the linear space
    of all cochains of dimension i living on X.
    :math:`X^s_{i}` is cochain in  :math:`C^s(X)`
    W is a trainable parameter.
    [1] This is essentially an implementation of equation 2.3
       given in https://openreview.net/pdf?id=6Tq18ySFpGU
    See also [2,3].
    Introduction:
    -------------
        An A_operator :math:`C^{in}(X)->C^{out}(X)`
        is a matrix that moves a cochain x
        that reside on all simplices/cells on X of a specific dimension
        (here it is the "in" dimension) to a signal that lives on
        on simplicies of dimension "out". Concretly, A_operator is a
        cochain map that operators that sends a signal in :math:`C^{in}(X)`
        to a signal in :math:`C^{in}(X)`.
        Given the operator A_opt, the LTN operator induced by it
        is also a map that operates between the same cochain spaces.
         Assuming x is of shape [n_in_cell, num_features_in ]
        then typically A_operator is a
        (co)boundary matrix/ k-Hodge Laplacian/k-(co)adjacency/
        matrix of shape [num_out_cell,n_in_cell ].
        Args:
            in_ft (int): dimension of input features.
            out_ft (int): positive int, dimension of out features.
            dropout (float,optional): default is 0.0.
            bias (bool,optional): default is True.
            init_scheme (str,optional): the initializer for the
                weight, default is xavier, other options : debug.
