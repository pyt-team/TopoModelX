    """Layer of a Convolutional Cell Complex Network (CCXN).

    Implementation of a simplified version of the CCXN layer proposed in [HIZ20]_.

    This layer is composed of two convolutional layers:
    1. A convolutional layer sending messages from nodes to nodes.
    2. A convolutional layer sending messages from edges to faces.
    Optionally, attention mechanisms can be used.

    Notes
    -----
    This is the architecture proposed for entire complex classification.

        The forward pass was initially proposed in [HIZ20]_.
        Its equations are given in [TNN23]_ and graphically illustrated in [PSHM23]_.

        The forward pass of this layer is composed of two steps.

        1. The convolution from nodes to nodes is given by an adjacency message passing scheme (AMPS):

        ..  math::
            \begin{align*}
            &🟥 \quad m_{y \rightarrow \{z\} \rightarrow x}^{(0 \rightarrow 1 \rightarrow 0)}
                = M_{\mathcal{L}_\uparrow}(h_x^{(0)}, h_y^{(0)}, \Theta^{(y \rightarrow x)})\\
            &🟧 \quad m_x^{(0 \rightarrow 1 \rightarrow 0)}
                = \text{AGG}_{y \in \mathcal{L}_\uparrow(x)}(m_{y \rightarrow \{z\} \rightarrow x}^{0 \rightarrow 1 \rightarrow 0})\\
            &🟩 \quad m_x^{(0)}
                = m_x^{(0 \rightarrow 1 \rightarrow 0)}\\
            &🟦 \quad h_x^{t+1,(0)}
                = U^{t}(h_x^{(0)}, m_x^{(0)})
            \end{align*}

        2. The convolution from edges to faces is given by cohomology message passing scheme, using the coboundary neighborhood:

        .. math::
            \begin{align*}
            &🟥 \quad m_{y \rightarrow x}^{(r' \rightarrow r)}
                = M^t_{\mathcal{C}}(h_{x}^{t,(r)}, h_y^{t,(r')}, x, y)\\
            &🟧 \quad m_x^{(r' \rightarrow r)}
                = \text{AGG}_{y \in \mathcal{C}(x)} m_{y \rightarrow x}^{(r' \rightarrow r)}\\
            &🟩 \quad m_x^{(r)}
                = m_x^{(r' \rightarrow r)}\\
            &🟦 \quad h_{x}^{t+1,(r)}
                = U^{t,(r)}(h_{x}^{t,(r)}, m_{x}^{(r)})
            \end{align*}
