        "# Train a Simplicial Attention Network (SAN)\n",
        "\n",
        "We create and train a Simplicial Attention Neural Networks (SAN) originally proposed in [Giusti*, Battiloro* et. al : Simplicial Attention Neural Networks (2022)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.07485). The scope of this notebook is to be didactic and clear, for further technical and implementation details please refer to the original paper and the TopoModelX documentation.\n",

        "### Abstract\n",
        "The aim of this work is to introduce simplicial attention networks (SANs), i.e., novel neural architectures that operate on data defined on simplicial complexes leveraging masked self-attentional layers. Hinging on formal arguments from topological signal processing, we introduce a proper self-attention mechanism able to process data components at different layers (e.g., nodes, edges, triangles, and so on), while learning how to weight both upper and lower neighborhoods of the given topological domain in a totally task-oriented fashion. The proposed SANs generalize most of the current architectures available for processing data defined on simplicial complexes.\n",
