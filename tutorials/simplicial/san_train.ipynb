    "# Train a Simplicial Attention Network (SAN)\n",
    "\n",
    "We create and train a Simplicial Attention Neural Networks (SAN) originally proposed in [Giusti*, Battiloro* et. al : Simplicial Attention Neural Networks (2022)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.07485). The aim of this notebook is to be didactic and clear, for further technical and implementation details please refer to the original paper and the TopoModelX documentation.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Abstract\n",
    "The aim of this work is to introduce simplicial attention networks (SANs), i.e., novel neural architectures that operate on data defined on simplicial complexes leveraging masked self-attentional layers. Hinging on formal arguments from topological signal processing, we introduce a proper self-attention mechanism able to process data components at different layers (e.g., nodes, edges, triangles, and so on), while learning how to weight both upper and lower neighborhoods of the given topological domain in a totally task-oriented fashion. The proposed SANs generalize most of the current architectures available for processing data defined on simplicial complexes.\n",

    "### The Neural Network\n",
    "The SAN layer takes rank-$r$ signals as input  and gives rank-$r$ signals as output. The involved neighborhoods are:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "\\mathcal N = \\{\\mathcal N_1, \\mathcal N_2,...,\\mathcal N_{2p+1}\\} =  \\{A_{\\uparrow, r}, A_{\\downarrow, r}, A_{\\uparrow, r}^2, A_{\\downarrow, r}^2,...,A_{\\uparrow, r}^p, A_{\\downarrow, r}^p, Q_r\\},\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "where $Q_r$ is a sparse projection operator (weighted matrix) over the kernel of the $r$-th Hodge Laplacian $L_r$, computed as in the original paper. $Q_r$ has the same topology of $L_r$.\n",
    "\n",
    "The equation of the SAN layer of this neural network is given by:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "\\textbf{h}_x^{t+1} =  \\phi^l \\Bigg ( \\textbf{h}_x^{t}, \\bigotimes_{\\mathcal{N}_k\\in\\mathcal N}\\bigoplus_{y \\in \\mathcal{N}_k(x)}  \\widetilde{\\alpha}_k(h_x^t,hy^t)\\Bigg ),\n",

    "with $\\widetilde{\\alpha}_k$ being either an attention function $\\alpha_k$ if $\\mathcal{N}_k \\neq Q_r$ or a standard convolution term(affine transformation + weights) with weights given by the entries of $Q_r$ if $\\mathcal{N}_k = Q_r$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, the SAN layer is made by an attentional convolution from rank-$r$ cells to rank-$r$ cells using an adjacency message passing scheme up to $p$-hops neighborhoods:\n",
