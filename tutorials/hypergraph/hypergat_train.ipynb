    "In this notebook, we will create and train a two-step message passing network **HyperGAT** ([Ding et al., 2020](https://aclanthology.org/2020.emnlp-main.399.pdf)) in the hypergraph domain. We will use a benchmark dataset, shrec16, a collection of 3D meshes, to train the model to perform classification at the level of the hypergraph. \n",

    "Given a hypergraph $G=(\\mathcal{V}, \\mathcal{E})$, where $|\\mathcal{V}|=n, |\\mathcal{V}|=m$, let $X \\in \\mathbb{R}^{n \\times d}$ and $Z \\in \\mathbb{R}^{m \\times d'}$ denote the hidden node and hyperedge representations, respectively. \n",

    "Given a specific node  $\\mathcal{v}_{i}$ , HyperGAT layer first learns the representations of all its connected hyperedges $\\mathcal{E}_{i}$ . As not all the nodes in a hyperedge  $\\mathcal{e}_{j} \\in \\mathcal{E}_{i}$ contribute equally to the hyperedge meaning, we introduce attention mechanism (i.e., node-level attention) to highlight those nodes that are important to the meaning of the hyperedge and then aggregate them to compute the hyperedge representation $\\mathcal{f}_{j}^{l}$. Formally:\n",

With all the hyperedges representations $ \\left\\{ \\mathcal{f}_{j}^{l}| \\forall{\\mathcal{e}_{j}} \\in \\mathcal{E}_{i}  \\right\\}$, we again apply an edge-level attention mechanism to highlight the informative hyperedges for learning the next-layer representation of node vi .
