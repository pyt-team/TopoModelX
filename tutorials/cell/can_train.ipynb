    "# Train a Cell Attention Network (CAN)\n",
    "\n",
    "We create and train a  Cell Attention Network (CAN) originally proposed in [Giusti et al. Cell Attention Networks (2022)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.08179). The aim of this notebook is to be didactic and clear, for further technical and implementation details please refer to the original paper and the TopoModelX documentation.\n",

    "### Abstract:\n",
    "\n",
    "Since their introduction, graph attention networks achieved outstanding results in graph representation learning tasks. However, these networks consider only pairwise relationships among nodes and then they are not able to fully exploit higher-order interactions present in many real world data-sets. In this paper, we introduce Cell Attention Networks (CANs), a neural architecture operating on data defined over the vertices of a graph, representing the graph as the 1-skeleton of a cell complex introduced to capture higher order interactions. In particular, we exploit the lower and upper neighborhoods, as encoded in the cell complex, to design two independent masked self-attention mechanisms, thus generalizing the conventional graph attention strategy. The approach used in CANs is hierarchical and it incorporates the following steps: i) a lifting algorithm that learns edge features from node features; ii) a cell attention mechanism to find the optimal combination of edge features over both lower and upper neighbors; iii) a hierarchical edge pooling mechanism to extract a compact meaningful set of features. \n",
