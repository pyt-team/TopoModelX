# Tutorials

This section contains tutorials for a variety of topological neural networks.

## Contribution

To add an additional tutorial follow the following:
1. Prepare a well documented and self-explanatory .ipynb file using various modules of the library.
2. Place your notebook in the right directory depending on the data structure used. e.g. cell for Cellular Complex
3. The notebook title (H1 heading) will be displayed as the title of the notebook in the Sphinx Notebook Gallery, so please chose that wisely.
4. Make sure the notebook is able to test pytest for the notebook.
5. Prepare a thumbnail (ideally a tensor diagram) for the notebook.
6. Place the thumbnail in the docs/_thumbnails under the correct directory. "cell" directory in our example as used above.
7. Make sure to change the conf.py file present within docs to include the thumbnail to be included in Sphinx generated Gallery.
